## Next Steps

### 1. Create New Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a new **private** repository named `yashvekaria.com`
2. Upload all the files from the `/Users/yvekaria/Documents/MyWebsite/` directory
3. Commit and push the files

### 2. Set Up Custom Domain
1. In your repository, go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch" → main branch
3. Under "Custom domain", enter `yashvekaria.com`
4. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
5. Save the settings

### 3. Configure DNS
Contact your domain registrar and add these DNS records:

**A Records:**
```
yashvekaria.com → 185.199.108.153
yashvekaria.com → 185.199.109.153
yashvekaria.com → 185.199.110.153

```

**CNAME Record:**
```
www.yashvekaria.com → yash-vekaria.github.io
```

### 4. Set Up Redirect (Optional)
To redirect visitors from `yash-vekaria.github.io` to `yashvekaria.com`, add this JavaScript to the `<head>` section of your `index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if (window.location.hostname === 'yash-vekaria.github.io') {
    window.location.href = 'https://yashvekaria.com';
  }
</script>
```

### 5. Customize Content
